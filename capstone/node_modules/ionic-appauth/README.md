# Ionic App Auth
Ionic App Auth is a implementation of the [AppAuth-JS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS) for Ionic Users.
It includes code extensions for core cordova plugins to run the Ionic app such as [Advanced HTTP](https://github.com/silkimen/cordova-plugin-advanced-http) and [SafariViewController](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller).

The cordova plugins are optional and can be replaced with Angular/React/Vue http handlers and/or Capacitor Plugins.
This library is intended to be as flexiable with compatiablity as ionic V4 is attempting to be.

## Installation
Run following command to install Ionic App Auth in your project.

```bash
npm install ionic-appauth --save
```
